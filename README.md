# Experimental visualizations of depth maps with WebGL in elm

The goal of this repository is to provide an example
elm application for visualizations of static depth maps,
such as in the context of photometric stereo.

```sh
# Compile with eol2 the main currently selected in index.html
elm-optimize-level-2 src/MainTailRec.elm
```
